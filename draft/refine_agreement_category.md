## Proposal for new category refine_agreement

# Introduction

The core CIF dictionary tabulates the agreement between model and
observation in the `refln` category.  This tabulation is clearly
model-specific, in that it expects each observation to be linked to a
single `hkl` value. The present proposal provides a category that
tabulates agreement between model and observation in a generic way.
